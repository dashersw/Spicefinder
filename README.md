# Spicefinder

The idea is to find spices for specific recepies. For now I have just one-to-one copied the logic of the meetup example from the first class to practice, try to understand+remember. 

But the problem is that it's not clear to me how adding a second interaction should work: lookfor in line 47 - as in find the spices in your kitchen - one spice can only be at one location. I am probably missing something very basic here, but I thought I would ask instead of struggling for (another few) hours.
