# Spicefinder

The aim is to find spices for specific recepies. The original idea was to share rare spices in a building, to check which one of your neightbours has it so you don't have to buy it. For now, the _Location_ is within your own kitchen, for the sake of clarity (for me:).

Classes: Spice, Recepie, Location

A spice can be used for various recepies. <br>
One spice can only be at one location. (Ideally, if you share.) <br>
A recepie needs one or more rare spices. <br>
Locations can have more spices. (Could, but not yet.) <br>

Interaction: A spice can be added to recepies. A spice can be found at one location?!
